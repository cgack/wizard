WIZARD
======

This is a nodejs implementation of the card game Wizard. This version is still pretty raw so join in to make it rock.  The latest stable version can be found at http://wiz.jit.su, but of course you can run your own version via node

`$ node app.js`

which by default starts up a server on port 8080 of your local machine.
